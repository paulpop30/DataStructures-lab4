L4: Hashtable

Implement in C++ the given container (ADT) using a given representation and a hash table with a given collision resolution (separate chaining, coalesced chaining, open addressing) as a data structure. You are not allowed to use any container or data structure from STL or from any other library. Please do not implement a separate class for the hash table (or dynamic array, or anything), but implement the container directly.If you need to sort elements, you have to implement your own sorting algorithm.

ADT MultiMap â€“ using a hash table with open addressing and quadratic probing in which (key, value) pairs are stored. If a key has multiple values, it appears in multiple pairs
